**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**
Automated and manual QA testing help uncover weakness in software related to functionality and security. A suite of JUnit tests could be written and applied to the software as new code is developed. Additionally, boundary testing the software can reveal vulnerabilities. For example, if the name is more than 40 characters long, how does the program behave?

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
The user needs are carefully gathered in the requirements gathering stage of the SDLC. Depending on the size of project, QA Engineer(s)/Developers will translate these user needs into a suite of tests. Until these tests are passed, the software cannot be deployed.

**How do I approach designing software?**
Software should be designed with the user needs as the primary consideration. Test driven development is a good strategy to ensure the software stays focused on satisfying the user needs.
